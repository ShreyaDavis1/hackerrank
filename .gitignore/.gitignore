Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from  to  for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.

We define the rating for Alice's challenge to be the triplet , and the rating for Bob's challenge to be the triplet .

Your task is to find their comparison points by comparing  with ,  with , and  with .

If , then Alice is awarded  point.
If , then Bob is awarded  point.
If , then neither person receives a point.
Comparison points is the total points a person earned.

Given  and , can you compare the two challenges and print their respective comparison
